<h1>Hi There!</h1>
<p>Hi there, my name is Alan David Procter.</p>
<p>I am someone who loves a good challenge and that's why I have taken up coding.</p>
<p>I am easy going and approachable, always willing to lend a helping hand to anyone who needs it.</p>

<p>I am excited about the journey I have started in my life and can't wait to see where it takes me.

When it comes to my social life, I enjoy nothing more than spending time with my friends over a pint whilst playing snooker, after a round of golf or after a game of crown green bowls.</p>
